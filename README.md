# Project Description, Introduction and Objective
In this project, data science & analytics skills were used to explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations and generate insights.
The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle, which includes columns such as 'Order ID', 'Product', 'Quantity Ordered', 'Price Each', 'Ordered date', 'Status', 
'Purchase', 'Address'.

The Mobile Gadget Accessories Sales Store database, was created in Postgresql with the table which contains the columns listed above. The data was inspected, 
so as to have an understanding of some of its features, check for missing values and duplicates. Analysis was then performed on the data by answering certain questions
using SQL, followed by getting more insight through visualization using Tableau. The following questions are answered during the analysis:

* Which product has most order?
* Which product is with highest quantity ordered?
* Look at the product with most order and total quantity ordered
* Consider the price of each product to be able to determine the trend of the frequency of order and quantity
* See order of products by month to determine which product made most sales in each month
* Lets see products that are frequently sold together?
